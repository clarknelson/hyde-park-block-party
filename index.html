            The Silver Room Sound System Block Party, started in 2002, celebrates cultural diversity through expression, music and art, and is a free event organized by The Silver Room and owner, Eric Williams along with Ron Trent. Once a quaint affair for friends and family of The Silver Room, the event has grown into a vibrant and diverse, all-ages, neighborhood gathering and continues to be a platform for famed and up-and-coming artists from the Chicago-land area.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, we're proud to partner for the second time with Downtown Hyde Park Chicago (Special Service Area #61) to present the 14th Annual Silver Room Sound System Block Party on Saturday, July 15th, 2017. For residents and visitors alike, Downtown Hyde Park is not simply a commercial corridor found in any Chicago neighborhood... Downtown Hyde Park is its own small town - embracing and supporting a rich blend of shopping, dining, cultural attractions and business services - that invites those who walk its streets to experience the neighborhood's storied history of eclecticism, warmth and individuality.
